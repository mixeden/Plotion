# Plotion
A tool which plots in Notion automatically.

Actually this repo is based on my article on Medium:
https://medium.com/@mixeden/developing-a-tool-which-plots-in-notion-automatically-17c454bb4e2

Some ideas for the community:
 - Support for different formats including categories and so on
 - A special page with list of pages with plots.
